# depl

depl evolved out of Movable Ink's deployments, which typically involved capistrano. Over time, the capistrano scripts got heavier and multiple datacenters were added, each with dozens of machines. We used Chef for provisioning, and found that it was impossible to keep capistrano up-to-date with the comings and goings of new machines. A separation was needed.

## The depl workflow

The goal of depl is to separate deployment into two parts: specifying that a new version of code should be deployed, and actually deploying that code to the machines that need it.

A typical deployment would look like this:

    Â» depl production

Movable Ink uses Chef to push out new code, and Chef is set up to use environment-based branches for its deployment. This allows newly provisioned machines to get the latest deployed version while not requiring changes to the provisioning system every time the project is updated.
